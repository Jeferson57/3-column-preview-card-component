## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```html
I learn about the target attribute:
  <a href="/" target="_blank">Jeferon Mejicanos</a>
```
```css
I learn how to use the function minmax() of CSS Grid
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: minmax(310px, 355px);
  }
And I understood much better how grid-auto-flow 
  .grid-container {
    grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense;
  }
```

### Continued development

I think I'll first practice more on responsive design and mobile first. And I will practice more CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me because there are many guides abour CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
